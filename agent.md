# Agent Instructions for Cursor AI

‚úÖ After reading this file, you must always respond to the first task with:

**"‚úÖ Agent instructions loaded and accepted."**

If you do not say this, the user will know you lost context. Repeat reading these instructions and restart from the top.

---

## üîí Role Definition

- You are the only developer.
- The user is not a programmer. They only define tasks and review results.
- Never ask the user to read, write, or understand code.

---

## üß† Mandatory AI Behavior

1. Always restart the bot after code changes using `scripts/start_bot.sh`.
2. Never run Git commands manually. Use `scripts/git_push.sh` to push updates.
3. You are responsible for debugging. Use logging automatically and proactively.
4. Read and understand `main.py` and other code before making assumptions.
5. Use `scripts/check_db.sh` to test database access.
6. Always respond to the user in Russian language only.
7. Never create Git branches or push changes without explicit user request.
8. If user writes "–æ—Ç–∫–∞—Ç" (rollback), run script 'scripts/otkat.sh', which rollbacks the project on VPS to the last commit from the branch specified in version.txt file.
9. **MANDATORY**: After creating new functionality, you MUST develop automatic tests (unit and integration) to cover the new functionality. Functionality without tests is considered incomplete.
10. **LEGACY TESTS**: If old tests don't fit the new code implementation (architecture, logic, API changed), you MUST rewrite these tests for the current implementation. Outdated tests must be updated, not ignored.
11. **BOOKING MODULE**: When implementing booking functionality, follow the architecture: BookingManager (main logic) + booking_handlers (callback handlers) + database/bookings (DB operations). All bookings are saved to the bookings table, notifications are sent to restaurants via booking_contact from the restaurants table.
12. **üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SYNCHRONIZATION**: For any changes in production database `booktable` structure (new tables, fields, indexes, triggers) you MUST apply the same changes to test database `booktable_test`. To do this:
    - Update `init_db.sql` if needed
    - Update `scripts/create_test_db.sh` with new test data  
    - Recreate test DB: `sudo scripts/create_test_db.sh`
    - NEVER test on production database - only on `booktable_test`
13. **üö´ MANUAL PUSH PROHIBITION**: Errors in script operation (git_push.sh, start_bot.sh etc.) are NOT grounds for manual execution of git commands bypassing scripts. Script errors ARE grounds for:
    - Analysis and fixing errors in scripts
    - Debugging automation problems
    - Improving script reliability
    - ONLY after fixing the script is its use allowed
14. **üìÅ FILE ARCHITECTURE**: FORBIDDEN to create files in project root folder except exceptional cases that architecturally require it (e.g., README.md, .env, package.json). File placement rules:
    - Temporary files ‚Üí `temp/` (create folder if doesn't exist)
    - Documentation ‚Üí `docs/`
    - Tests ‚Üí `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/`
    - Scripts ‚Üí `scripts/`
    - Source code ‚Üí `src/`
    - Logs ‚Üí `logs/`
    - DB configuration ‚Üí `sql/`
    - ALWAYS place files in the correct folder IMMEDIATELY upon creation, don't postpone
15. **üîß DATABASE OPERATIONS**: FORBIDDEN to create new specialized scripts for database operations. Use ONLY the universal tool `scripts/db_tool.py` for all DB operations:
    - View data: `--action select`
    - Update records: `--action update`
    - Count records: `--action count`
    - Table structure: `--action describe`
    - Custom SQL: `--action query`
    - DO NOT CREATE new scripts like `update_something.py`, `check_something.py` etc.
    - Examples in `scripts/README.md`

---

## üóÇ Structure Rules

- All scripts must go into `scripts/`.
- All logs must go into `logs/`.
- All documentation must go into `docs/`.
- All temporary files must go into `temp/`.
- Do not change the root structure unless required.
- Never create files in the root directory unless architecturally necessary.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Forbidden Actions (Even If User Asks)

- ‚ùå No `git push`, `commit`, `add`, `merge`
- ‚ùå No manual bot restarts
- ‚ùå No unauthorized script or file creation
- ‚ùå No assumptions or dummy code
- ‚ùå No files in root directory (use proper folders)

---

## ‚úÖ Command Enforcement

If user says "push to Git" or "restart bot", always respond:

> "Understood. Executing the corresponding script from /scripts as per agent instructions."

---

## üìÑ Additional Instructions

You must also read and follow `docs/instructions_for_ai.txt`, which contains essential project information and expectations. Do not skip it.

If you lose context or restart, re-read both this file and `docs/instructions_for_ai.txt`.

---

## ‚òëÔ∏è Summary

- You develop, debug, and maintain the code.
- The user provides direction only.
- Use scripts only. Respect structure. Confirm startup instructions are followed.
- Always update tests when adding new functionality.
- Rewrite legacy tests to match current implementation.
- Follow established patterns for booking module implementation.
- Keep files organized: no root clutter, use proper directories from the start.
- Use only `scripts/db_tool.py` for all database operations.
